      "transcript": "Hello, this is Jack Melo and my email is jack.melo@example.com. I live at 456 Oak Street in Miami, Florida 33101. I work for Melo Real Estate Group. I'm motivated to sell my property because I want to save on commission fees and avoid high realtor costs. I'm asking $525,000 for my home. I need to sell within the next 2-4 months because I'm relocating to California for a new business opportunity. My biggest frustration has been dealing with agents who don't communicate well. I had a bad experience with my last agent who was always late and unprofessional. I'm concerned about getting the right price and finding serious buyers. I'm definitely open to working with a professional agent if they can show me they're different. I'd like to schedule an appointment for this Friday, September 12th at 12:00 PM to discuss my listing options.",
